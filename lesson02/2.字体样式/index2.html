    TIL KINGDOM COME <br>
    　　One... two... <br>
    　　Steal my heart... and hold my tongue <br>
    　　I feel my time... my time has come <br>
    　　Let me in... unlock the door <br>
    　　I never felt this way before <br>
    　　And the wheels just keep on turning <br>
    　　The drummer begins to drum <br>
    　　I don't know which way I'm going <br>
    　　I don't know which way I've come <br>
    　　Hold my head... inside your hands<br>
    　　I need someone... who understands<br>
    　　I need someone... someone who hears<br>
    　　For you I've waited all these years<br>
    　　For you I'd wait... 'Til Kingdom Come<br>
    　　Until my day... my day is done<br>
    　　and say you'll come... and set me free<br>
    　　just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me<br>
    　　In your tears... and in your blood<br>
    　　In your fire... and in your flood<br>
    　　I hear you laugh... I heard you sing<br>
    　　I wouldn't change a single thing<br>
    　　And the wheels just keep on turning<br>
    　　The drummers begin to drum<br>
    　　I don't know which way I'm going<br>
    　　I don't know what I've become<br>
    　　For you I'd wait... 'Til kingdom come<br>
    　　Until my days... my days are done<br>
    　　Say you'll come... and set me free<br>
    　　Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me<br>
    　　Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me<br>
    　　Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me<br>
